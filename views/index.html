    <h2>Most Historic Spanish Rap Group Ever</h2>
    <p>
      Violadores del Verso (Spanish: Lyrical Molesters or Verse Rapists), also known as Doble V, are a rap music crew from
      Zaragoza, Spain. They used the name Doble V[1] but were forced to return to their original long name due to legal issues
      (Doble V is also the trademark of a Spanish whiskey). The band members are MCs Kase.O, LÃ­rico, Sho-Hai (also known as
      Hate) and DJ R de Rumba.
      
      Violadores del Verso won the gold record for Vivir para contarlo (2006), and together with SFDK they are the only
      Spanish rap groups to have won a gold record to date.[2] Violadores del Verso are often considered the greatest Spanish
      hip hop group in history and one of the most influential Spanish-speaking hip hop artists of all time.
      
      The group has been on a long pause since 2010 as they wanted to grow separate careers and be creators on their own.
